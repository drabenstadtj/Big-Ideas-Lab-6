# Big-Ideas-Lab-6
This program takes two inputs from the user: a name and another input. It then ensures that the inputs are of the same length and interpolates them by alternating their letters. If one input is longer than the other, the additional letters from the longer input are appended to the end of the interpolated string. Finally, the program prints the interpolated string with alternating letters.
